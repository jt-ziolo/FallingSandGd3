# Changelog

## v0.0.1 (Initial Commit)

### Known bugs:
- Releasing the mouse button does not stop sand from falling (intended: sand
  should only be painted onto the screen when the left mouse button is held
  down)
- Changing viewport size allows access to additional areas that get cut off
  when it is resized again (intended: viewport scales when resized)

### Added or Changed
- Initial Commit
- Click to place sand, which falls to the bottom of the screen. The bottom of
  the screen currently acts as a floor

### Removed

- None
