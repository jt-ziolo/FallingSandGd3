## Getting Started (Development)

To start Godot 3.5 development using this project as a template follow these steps.

#### Prerequisites

This project was developed using a Godot 3.5 standalone install on Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS and Windows 10, additional steps may be required for development with other installations or on other operating systems.

#### Installation

1. Download the mono (.NET) version of Godot 3.5.1-stable at [https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/tag/3.5.1-stable](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/tag/3.5.1-stable)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git init
   git clone https://github.com/jt-ziolo/FallingSandGd3.git
   ```
3. Open the project under `FallingSandGd3/godot` using Godot
4. Download the GUT (Godot Unit Test) addon v7.4.1 from Godot's built-in AssetLib, or get it at [https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/releases/tag/v7.4.1](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/releases/tag/v7.4.1), AssetLib places the addon in `./godot/addons/gut/`
5. Shell and batch scripts to run GUT tests are included in `FallingSandGd3/`. See the GUT GitHub repo wiki for additional information on how to configure these scripts.



## Future Plans

This project was created as a learning project; there are no plans for further development at this time. However, I will monitor [open issues](https://github.com/jt-ziolo/FallingSandGd3/issues) for any proposed features and issues and may revisit this project when time allows.
